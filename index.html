<h2><u>What is Covid 19</u></h2>
<p> A new virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of a disease that began in China in 2019. The resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
    In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it had classified COVID-19 as a pandemic. Pandemic public health groups monitor and post updates online, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). These groups have also issued recommendations on preventing the spread of the virus.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

    Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
    
    The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
    
    The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>

<p>Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may appear two to 14 days after exposure. The period following exposure and prior to the onset of symptoms is called the incubation period. Common questions and symptoms can include:
<ul>
   <li> fever</li>
   <li> cough</li>
   <li>Tired</li>
    It may indicate another problem.
   <b> Other symptoms could be:</b>
    
    <li>Breathing difficulty</li>
    <li> muscle pain</li>
        <li>  chills</li>
            <li>Sore throat</li>
                <li>  Runny nose</li>
    <li>headache</li>
    <li>chest pain</li>
   <li>Conjunctivitis</li>
   <li> nausea</li>
   <li> vomiting</li>
  <li>diarrhea</li>
    <li>Skin rash</li>
    This list is not exhaustive. Infections show symptoms.The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Some people may have only a few symptoms, and some people may have no symptoms at all. Some people may experience worsening of symptoms, such as worsening shortness of breath and worsening pneumonia, about a week after symptoms begin.

    Older people are at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms, and this risk increases as a person gets older. People with pre-existing medical conditions may be more likely to develop serious symptoms. Examples of serious health conditions that increase your risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms include:
    
    Serious heart disease, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathy
    cancer
    Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
    type 2 diabetes
    Obesity or severe obesity
    smokingChronic kidney disease
    sickle cell disease
    Weakened immune system due to solid organ transplants
    pregnancy
    <b>There are other conditions that increase the risk of serious symptoms, such as:</b>
    
    <li>asthma</li>
    <li>Liver disease</li>
   <li> overweight</li>
    Chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or pulmonary fibrosis
    Medical conditions related to the brain and nervous system
    Weakened immune system due to bone marrow transplant, HIV, or certain medications
    Type 1 diabetes
    Hypertension</p>

<P>Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19.

    If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!
    
    Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal of masks are essential to make them as effective as possible.
    
    Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:
    
    Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
    Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. 
    When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.
    Don’t use masks with valves.Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. Follow the directions given by your local health authorities.
    To help prevent the spread of COVID-19:
    Wash your hands frequently. Use soap and water or an alcohol-based solution to sanitize your hands.
    Keep a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
    Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
    Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
    Cover your nose and mouth with your elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
    Stay home if you feel sick.
    Seek medical attention if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
    Your health care provider should be contacted before proceeding so that they can quickly direct you to the appropriate care facility. This helps protect you and avoid the spread of viruses and other diseases.</P>
